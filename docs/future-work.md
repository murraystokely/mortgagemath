# Future work

## Sources that did not match the library

These sources were investigated as candidate test fixtures but rejected
because at least one published value could not be reproduced exactly by
the library. They are recorded here in case the underlying issue is
worth revisiting later — either because we add a new amortization mode
that does match, or because we want to understand the variance among
published references.

The standing rule (see `tests/schedules/README.md`) is that a fixture
must reproduce **every** value the source attests to, or it does not go
in the test suite. Partial matches are not committed; they bury
divergences that could mask real bugs.

### Textbook sources

- **LibreTexts Business Math** (Olivier), §13.03, "Tamara's dishwasher
  loan" ($895.94 / 5.9% / 6mo). Library matches the monthly payment,
  row 1, and total interest. Rows 2–5 diverge by 1 cent each because
  the textbook applies a per-line "missing-pennies" reconciliation we
  could not reverse-engineer from the published prose.
- **eCampus Ontario** *Mathematics of Finance*, Example 4.3.4
  ($308,000 / 4.62% / 180mo). Library matches the monthly payment and
  row 21. The textbook's published "balance after payment 20"
  ($283,323.39) differs from the library's $283,323.40 by a single cent.
- **OpenStax Contemporary Math** §6.8 sample table
  ($10,000 / 4.75% / 240mo). Library matches monthly payment, month-10
  interest, and month-15 balance. Cumulative-interest at month 18
  differs by 4 cents.
- **OpenStax *Principles of Finance*** §8.3 (auto and home examples).
  Library matches monthly payment and row 1 in both. Total-interest
  figures published with each example differ from the library's by 2
  and 12 cents respectively.
- **Pima Open Press** *Topics in Mathematics* §6.4 (three examples).
  - Short illustration ($500 / 12% / 6mo): textbook lets the schedule
    end at a $0.03 residual, while the library closes balance to zero
    with an adjusted final payment.
  - Two longer mortgages: cumulative balance and total-interest
    figures drift by single-digit cents.
- **OpenStax Contemporary Math** §6.12 Example 6.111
  ($99,596 / 5.35% / 360mo) — published total-paid and financing-cost
  figures differ from the library's by ~$2.
- **OpenStax Contemporary Math** §6.12 Example 6.113
  ($165,900 / 5.61% / 360mo) — payment-175 principal differs by 1
  cent, balance-after-payment-170 differs by 80 cents.
- **Las Positas College** §8.05 Examples 2 and 4 — three fixtures
  rejected because the textbooks publish total-cost or
  total-interest figures that the library does not match (drifts of
  $0.49 to $5.03 over loan life).

### Calculator and consumer-education sources

- **Chase consumer-education page** ($200,000 / 5% / 360mo). Library
  reproduces rows 1–3 exactly (the strongest row-level match in any
  candidate). Row 360 differs because Chase's schedule winds down to a
  small natural residue, while the library adjusts the final payment
  to zero out the balance.

### Sources requiring algorithms the library does not implement

- **Various Canadian textbook examples** (Maksim's Apartment, the
  Olivers, the Chans, Kerry's Toyota Rav4). Use the semi-annual
  compounding required by Canadian mortgage law (the periodic rate is
  derived from a semi-annually-compounded nominal rate, not from
  monthly compounding). The library uses monthly compounding only.
- **Kerry's Toyota Rav4** specifically also chose a non-actuarial
  whole-dollar payment ($2,691 instead of the closed-form $2,690.05),
  which puts the loan outside the closed-form annuity model.
- **William Hart, *Mathematics of Investment*** (1924, archive.org)
  — worked example uses mill-precision (3 decimals), incompatible with
  the library's cent-rounding.

## Possible future work

- Investigate whether a configurable `BalanceTracking.CARRY_PRECISION`
  mode could be designed to match the LibreTexts dishwasher schedule
  (or any other authoritative source whose algorithm is fully
  specified). Past investigation rejected this — the textbooks we
  could read used per-line reconciliations we could not pin down — but
  if a new source emerges with a fully reproducible carry-precision
  algorithm, the design should be reconsidered.
- Investigate semi-annual / annual compounding to support Canadian
  mortgages and certain bond/annuity examples.
- Investigate Actual/360 schedule generation. `monthly_payment()`
  already supports it; `amortization_schedule()` raises on it.
